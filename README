------------------------------------------
DocBook is a schema (available in several languages including RELAX NG, 
SGML and XML DTDs, and W3C XML Schema) maintained by the DocBook 
Technical Committee of OASIS. It is particularly well suited to books 
and papers about computer hardware and software (though it is by no 
means limited to these applications).
